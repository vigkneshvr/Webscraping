# Webscraping
Webscraping data from https://books.toscrape.com/ using Python

Libraries required: pandas, beautifulsoup and shutil. Can be installed using environment.yml file.

Run the webScrape.py file and it'll save the book cover images in a new images folder category wise: 
        images
          |_book_category

It will also save other information ("title", "price", "rating", "category", "stock") about a book in a csv file.
